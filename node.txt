Node Js is a cross platform, Js runtime Environment which is built on top of chrome's v8 Engine. 
It helps execute JS code outside web-browser's.It has event driven architecture capable of asynchronous 
I/O.

The need for creating Node was earlier that there were servers which were blocking 
(Apache HTTP Server(Blocking Server)) so the Node was created which is a Non-Blocking I/O.


npm  is a tool that comes with Node.js,
 which is primarily used to manage packages (libraries or modules) in JavaScript.

 Before installing a package in our project we need to create a package.json file by 
 running npm init -y (to create a file with default settings) or npm init (if we want to configure it with manual 
 settings)
